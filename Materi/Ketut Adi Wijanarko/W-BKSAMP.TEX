%% for times math: However, this package disables bold math (!)
%% \mathbf{x} will still work, but you will not have bold math
%% in section heads or chapter titles. If you don't use math
%% in those environments, mathptmx might be a good choice.

% For PostScript text

%% Change options here if you want:

%%%%%%% Demo of section head containing sample macro:
%% To get a macro to expand correctly in a section head, with upper and
%% lower case math, put the definition and set the box 
%% before \begin{document}, so that when it appears in the 
%% table of contents it will also work:

\newcommand{\VT}[1]{\ensuremath{{V_{T#1}}}}

%% use a box to expand the macro before we put it into the section head:

\newbox\sectsavebox
\setbox\sectsavebox=\hbox{\boldmath\VT{xyz}}
